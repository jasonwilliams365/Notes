    "**Overview**  \n",
    "This guide shows how to launch a Free Tier-eligible Amazon EC2 instance and use it to practice basic development workflow operations. The steps include installing Python, installing Git, creating a local Git repository, making changes, pushing to GitHub, and collaborating with a partner to clone and branch each other’s repositories. All this work will be done directly on the EC2 instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS Free Tier Account**:  \n",
    "   Must have an AWS account set up under the Free Tier, as outlined in previous instructions.  \n",
    "   - Ensure the account is within the first 12 months of sign-up to leverage the Free Tier.\n",
    "   - Free Tier EC2 usage typically includes 750 hours per month of a t2.micro or t3.micro instance running Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Browser and AWS Console Access**:  \n",
    "   A web browser to access the AWS Management Console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GitHub Account**:  \n",
    "   Users should have a GitHub account ready. They will need a remote GitHub repository to push changes and to collaborate with partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SSH Key Pair (Optional)**:  \n",
    "   If opting to connect via SSH from a local machine, have or create an SSH key pair. AWS can also generate one during instance creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching a Free Tier-Eligible EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log In to AWS Console**:  \n",
    "   Navigate to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in to the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Go to EC2 Service**:  \n",
    "   In the search bar, type \"EC2\" and click on **EC2** under \"Services.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Launch Instance**:  \n",
    "   - Click **Launch instances**.\n",
    "   - Give the instance a name (e.g., “FreeTier-Dev-Instance”).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**:  \n",
    "   - Select an **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** or **Ubuntu Server** AMI that is marked \"Free tier eligible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choose an Instance Type**:  \n",
    "   - Select **t2.micro** or **t3.micro** to stay within the Free Tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Key Pair (Login)**:  \n",
    "   - If you have no key pair, select **Create new key pair**, choose **RSA** and a `.pem` file if on Linux/macOS or `.ppk` if using PuTTY on Windows.\n",
    "   - Download the key and keep it secure. You’ll need it to connect via SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Network Settings**:  \n",
    "   - The default VPC and Subnet are fine. Ensure that SSH (port 22) is allowed from your IP to access the instance via terminal.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If you plan to connect via SSH:\n",
    "   - Set the inbound rule for SSH: Source = “My IP” for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Configure Storage**:  \n",
    "   - The default 8GB root volume is sufficient. Free Tier covers up to 30GB of EBS storage in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Launch the Instance**:  \n",
    "   Click **Launch Instance** and wait for the instance to initialize.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Find Your Instance**:  \n",
    "    Once launched, return to the EC2 dashboard and check the “Instances” section. Wait until the instance state is **running** and the status checks pass.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Select the instance in the EC2 console.\n",
    "2. Click **Connect**.\n",
    "3. Choose **EC2 Instance Connect** (browser-based SSH) and click **Connect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option B: Connect Using SSH**:  \n",
    "1. Open a terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where the key pair `.pem` file is located.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod 400 my-key.pem\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Connect to the instance (replace `ec2-user` and `<EC2-Public-DNS>` as provided in the EC2 console):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ssh -i \"my-key.pem\" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-DNS>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   For Ubuntu AMI, the user might be `ubuntu` instead of `ec2-user`.\n",

    "### Setting Up Git Credentials (Optional but Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure Git User Name and Email**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "   git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n",

    "### Pushing Changes to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:  \n",
    "   - On GitHub, create a new repository (do not initialize it with a README if you already have a commit locally).\n",
    "   - Copy the HTTPS URL of your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **On Each Partner’s EC2 Instance**:\n",
    "   - Move out of the current project directory:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     cd ~\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "### Monitoring Costs and Keeping Within the Free Tier\n",
    "\n",
    "- The EC2 t2.micro or t3.micro instance is covered under the Free Tier for up to 750 hours per month if the account is within the first 12 months.\n",
    "- Storing small files and pushing/pulling code from GitHub does not cost anything extra from AWS’s side. (GitHub usage might have its own limits, but for normal small projects, it’s free.)\n",
    "- When finished practicing:\n",
    "  - **Stop or Terminate the EC2 Instance** to avoid unnecessary usage.\n",
    "  - In the EC2 Console, select the instance and choose **Instance state > Stop** (or **Terminate** if no longer needed).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Stopping prevents further EC2 compute charges from accruing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set Up EC2 Instance**: Launch a Free Tier eligible instance.\n",
    "- **Connect and Install Tools**: SSH into the instance, install Python and Git.\n",
    "- **Git Setup**: Initialize a local repo, create files, commit changes.\n",
    "- **Push to GitHub**: Link remote repo and push local changes.\n",
    "- **Collaborate**: Clone a partner’s repo, make changes, and commit them back.\n",
    "- **Branching**: Create a branch for new features and push it to GitHub.\n",
    "- **Clean Up**: Stop or terminate the instance to avoid costs beyond the Free Tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these detailed steps allows practicing a full development and collaboration workflow entirely on a cloud-based EC2 instance within the AWS Free Tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "Process was pretty streamlined. There were some issues with accessing the Git files in the EC2 instance regarding permissions but other than that there were no issues for me.\n",
