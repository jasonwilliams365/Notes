    "1. **Key Goal**: Develop an understanding of how databases form a critical part of modern backend systems.  \n",
    "2. **Why It Matters**: Databases enable data persistence, efficient queries, and dynamic user experiences.\n",

    "### **Part 1: What Is a Database?**\n",
    "- A database is a structured collection of data that a computer system can store, manage, and retrieve efficiently.  \n",
    "- Databases allow you to centralize information and perform operations like querying, sorting, and aggregating _________.  \n",

    "### **Part 2: A Brief History of Databases**\n",
    "1. **Early Systems (1960s & 1970s)**  \n",
    "   - Stored data in hierarchical or network models.  \n",
    "   - These systems were rigid and difficult to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rise of Relational Databases (1970s & 1980s)**  \n",
    "   - Edgar F. Codd’s relational model introduced the concept of storing data in table with rows and columns.  \n",
    "   - Led to the creation of Structured Query Langugage(SQL), the structured query language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization & Standardization (1980s & 1990s)**  \n",
    "   - Relational databases became the industry standard.  \n",
    "   - SQL matured.  \n",
    "   - Normalization was embraced to reduce redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The NoSQL Movement (2000s & Beyond)**  \n",
    "   - Emerged due to explosion of web-scaled and unstructered data.  \n",
    "   - Examples: document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notes/Reflections**:  \n",
    "> - Reasons relational databases became so popular: \n",
    "- Commerical and open-source embraced relational database management system (RDBMS) \n",
    "> - Places where NoSQL might be more advantageous:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Relational Databases and SQL**\n",
    "- **Structure**: Data is organized into rows (records) and columns (attributes).  \n",
    "- **Relationships**: Defined by keys (e.g., primary key, foreign key).  \n",
    "- **Advantages**:  \n",
    "  - Data integrity through constraints.  \n",
    "  - Powerful querying with SQL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Your Own Example**:  \n",
    "> - Imagine a “Users” table and a “Products” table. How might they relate?  \n",
    "> - Personal Notes:\n",
    " - ACID\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 4: Basic SQL Concepts**\n",
    "1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**  \n",
    "   - Statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP defined and modify structure of database objects (e.g., CREATE TABLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**  \n",
    "   - Statements like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.  \n",
    "   - Used to modify data in tables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**  \n",
    "   - Primarily the SELECT statement.  \n",
    "   - Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Control Language (DCL) & Transaction Control**  \n",
    "   - Example statements: GRANT and REVOKE.  \n",
    "   - Transaction statements: COMMIT and ROLLBACK.  \n",

    "### **Part 5: Normalization and Database Design Principles**\n",
    "- **Normalization** helps avoid data redundancy, inconsistency, and confusion.  \n",
    "- Common Normal Forms:  \n",
    "  - **1NF**: Columns hold atomic(No repeating groups or arrays of data in single column) values.  \n",
    "  - **2NF**: Every non-key column depends on the entire primary key (if composite(made of multiple columns)).  \n",
    "  - **3NF**: No transitive dependencies, meaning non-key columns do not rely on other non-key columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Think About It**: \n",
    "> - Start from a normalized foundation for future denormalization. \n",
    "> - Why is it risky to store all data in a single table?  \n",
    "> - Personal Notes or Examples of normalization in your own projects:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 6: Indexing and Query Optimization**\n",
    "- **Definition**: An index is like a book’s index; it helps the database quickly find rows by looking at the indexed column(s).  \n",
    "- **Pros**: Faster read queries, improved user experience.  \n",
    "- **Cons**: Slower writes, increased storage usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reflection**:  \n",
    "> - Think of a real-world scenario where an index might be invaluable:  \n",
    "> - Personal Examples or Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 7: Transactions and ACID Properties**\n",
    "1. **Atomicity**: “All or nothing” — if any part of a transaction fails, the changes are rolled back.  \n",
    "2. **Consistency**: Transactions move the database from one valid state to another, respecting all data states.  \n",
    "3. **Isolation**: Ensures concurrent transactions do not interfere each other’s results.  \n",
    "4. **Durability**: Once a transaction commits, changes persist even if there is a system crash/power loss.  \n",

    "### **Part 8: NoSQL Databases and Their Advantages**\n",
    "- **Why NoSQL?**  \n",
    "  - Flexible data models, horizontal scalability(wide - multiple, less-powerful machines(nodes)), performance at massive scale, etc.  \n",
    "- **Types**:  \n",
    "  1. **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB)  \n",
    "  2. **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis)  \n",

    "### **Part 9: Choosing the Right Database Technology**\n",
    "- **Relational**: Best if you need stong transactions, a stable schema, and complex queries.  \n",
    "- **NoSQL**: Best for huge datasets, rapidly evolving schemas, or real-time analytics.  \n",
    "- **Polyglot Approach**: Using both relational and NoSQL databases for different parts of an application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Your Decision Factors**:  \n",

    "3. **Monitoring & Performance Tuning**: Watch query performance, memory usage, and disk I/O.  \n",
    "4. **Updates & Patches**: Keep software up-to-date to fix bugs and close security vulnerabilities.  \n",
