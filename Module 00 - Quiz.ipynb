    "**Quiz: Module Zero – Foundations of Backend Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Fill-in-the-Blank Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The internet originated from a U.S. Department of Defense project called ARPANET, which connected a handful of universities in the late 1960s.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The TCP/IP protocol suite, standardized in the 1980s, allowed different networks to communicate, paving the way for the global internet we know today.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The introduction of DNS in 1983 gave the internet a more human-friendly address system, allowing users to type names like “example.com” instead of IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, introducing HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The OSI model is a seven-layer conceptual framework for understanding how data travels over a network, including layers for physical transmission, routing, and application-level interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using TLS to encrypt data in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent and does not retain user state between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. To ensure your application runs consistently across different environments, you can use ______________ to package and isolate your application and its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Docker is a container orchestration platform that manages scaling, failover, and deployment of containerized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In AWS, S3 is a highly durable object storage service for storing files like images, logs, and backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Short Answer Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Briefly explain why understanding the history of the internet can help a backend developer today.\n",
    " ANSWER: It helps backend developer understand how-why the Internet works the way it does the help make coding more streamlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe the role of DNS in a web request.\n",
    "ANSWER: DNS allows users to enter a domain name such as Facebook.com or US.gov rather than having to enter the entire IP address in order to visit a website\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS?\n",
    "ANSWER: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Name two common HTTP methods and explain when you would use each.\n",
    "ANSWER: GET and PUT. GET is used to fetch data from server without modding. PUT fully replaces existing data/existing resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How can the OSI model help developers troubleshoot network-related issues?\n",
    "ANSWER: Allows developers to understand the structure of a computer and a computer network for more pinpointed troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why is Docker important in modern backend development workflows?\n",
    "ANSWER: One reason would be that Docker helps to minimize the 'works on my machine' issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Give an example of a situation where Kubernetes would be beneficial for your application.\n",
    "ANSWER: Kubernetes would be useful for a big project that needs constant monitoring or patching. It would allow developers to push small patches/updates to keep applications at near-peak performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does AWS simplify infrastructure management for backend developers?\n",
    "ANSWER: AWS provides many services that allow backend developers to organize and de-complicate tasks such as scaling or creating a VR environment/server.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the significance of using proper HTTP status codes in API responses?\n",
    "ANSWER: Status codes help the user to know what the issue is they are facing and what may need to be done in order to correct those issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Explain one core principle of DevOps culture and why it matters in backend development.\n",
    "ANSWER: One core principle of DevOps culture is to never feel you HAVE to memorize everything. DevOps is a broad topic/category that encompasses a lot of different terms and rules. The ability to know how to research and troubleshoot is very important in DevOps.\n",
